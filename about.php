        AkuafoLink is a web service that seeks to bridge the gap between input suppliers, farmers, wholesalers, retailers, processors and consumers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Farmers have the opportunity to market their produce at their own rates, while interested buyers can request as many as made available by the farmer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Farmers can also purchase products from input suppliers as well as request for loans from the financial services in partnership with AkuafoLink.
